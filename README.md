# Termignaw

Termignaw is a work-in-progress terminal emulator written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com). It's primarily a way for me to practice and learn Odin and Raylib.

## build

Building Termignaw requires the Odin compiler. You can follow this [installation guide](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install).

You can build it using the build script `build.sh`.

To build it normally:

    ./build.sh normal

To build it with the debug flag:

    ./build.sh debug

Add `run` to also run the result:

    ./build.sh normal run

## notes

- This is work-in-progress and still very far from being a finished product.
- The tests are old and do not work.
